This is the website of Dr Robert Free's informatics group which is based within the respiratory theme of the NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre, in the Department of Respiratory Science.

The main focus of the group is on technology building for clinical and precision medicine and technology-driven research. This includes: creating solutions to help with the collection and handling of data by creating new tools, pipelines and data standards; and using data-driven approaches such as AI and machine learning to improve technologies and extract knowledge from existing clinical data to make real differences to clinical practice.
