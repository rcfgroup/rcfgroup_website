This project focuses on a new data standard (qISA) which can be used to manage metabolomics data and metadata, particularly related to breathomics, and user friendly tools for integrating existing data into the new standard and working with archives. The project builds upon the ISA standard, to introduce new data element types related to quality and validation which are not part of the original ISA specification.
