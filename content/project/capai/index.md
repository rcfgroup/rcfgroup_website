The CAP-AI project is a collaboration between the group, Prof. Alistair McEwan (Dept. of Engineering, UoL) and Dr. Gerrit Woltmann (Respiratory Medicine, UHL). It will use routinely collected health care data and apply modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to create models which could be used to help hospital staff deal with patients admitted with community acquired pneumonia (CAP). The ultimate aim is to produce a deeper understanding of the role and potential of AI in predicting disease progression and produce one or more promising AI model(s) for predicting CAP outcome.

It builds on work done by the PI and Dr. Woltmann looking at how CAP admission outcome at the UHL was affected following the introduction of a nurse-led intervention.
