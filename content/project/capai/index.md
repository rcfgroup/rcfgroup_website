The CAP-AI project is a collaboration between the group, Prof. Alistair McEwan and Dr. Gerrit Woltmann. It will use routinely collected health care data and apply modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to create models which could be used to help hospital staff deal with patients admitted with community acquired pneumonia (CAP). The ultimate aim is to produce a deeper understanding of the role and potential of AI in predicting disease progression and produce one or more promising AI model(s) for predicting CAP outcome.
