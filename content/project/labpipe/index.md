Data management in clinical metabolomics studies is often an ad-hoc manual process. Existing freely available software tools do not provide an effective solution to manage the data collection process in these studies.
LabPipe was created to streamline collection and management of both metadata and metabolomics data. It is driven through a local client which guides the sample collection process using customisable study-specific meta-data entry. Management and transfer of data is handled by a server through access controlled web services. The platform has been positively received by users and now is an essential study management component for clinical metabolomics locally.
